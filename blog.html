            <h2>Becoming a front end developer</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2015-06-14">June 14, 2015</time></p>
            <p>I would like to talk about becomming a front end developper.</p>
            <p>Differently from other technologies I have previously learned, learning front end seems to be a very bumpy road.</p>
            <p>Whenever I have learned how to write applications with other technologies I
                had one or maybe a few different ways of doing one thing.
                I could read several books and they would pretty much go the same direction.
                Now this is different. Every book bumps me in a different but somewhat similar direction.
                That can be quite confusing and somewhat frustrating. More on that later.

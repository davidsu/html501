                    <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. As a child, Einstein revealed an
                        extraordinary curiosity for understanding the mysteries of science (started only at age 10/11). A
                        typical child (only to his socio-economic class — educated middle class), Einstein took music
                        lessons,
                        playing both the violin and piano — a passion that followed him into adulthood. Moving first to
                        Italy
                        and then to Switzerland, the young prodigy graduated from high-school in 1896.</p>

                    <p>In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein had what came to be known as
                        his
                        “Annus Mirabilis” — or “miracle year”. It was during this time that the young physicist obtained his
                        Doctorate degree and published four of his most influential research papers, including the Special
                        Theory of Relativity. In that, the now world famous equation "e = mc2" unlocked mysteries of the
                        Universe theretofore unknown.</p>

                    <p>Ten years later, in 1915, Einstein completed his General Theory of Relativity and in 1921 he was
                        awarded
                        the Nobel Prize in Physics (iconic status cemented in 1919 when Arthur Eddington’s expedition
                        confirmed
                        Albert Einstein’s prediction). It also launched him to international superstardom and his name
                        became a
                        household word synonymous with genius all over the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>Einstein emigrated to the United States in the autumn of 1933 and took up residence in Princeton, New
                        Jersey and a professorship at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study.</p>

                    <p>Today, the practical applications of Einstein’s theories include the development of the television,
                        remote control devices, automatic door openers, lasers, and DVD-players. Recognized as TIME
                        magazine’s
                        “Person of the Century” in 1999, Einstein’s intellect, coupled his strong passion for social
                        justice
                        and dedication to pacifism, left the world with infinite knowledge and pioneering moral
                        leadership.</p>

                <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. As a child, Einstein revealed an
                    extraordinary curiosity for understanding the mysteries of science (started only at age 10/11). A
                    typical child (only to his socio-economic class — educated middle class), Einstein took music
                    lessons,
                    playing both the violin and piano — a passion that followed him into adulthood. Moving first to
                    Italy
                    and then to Switzerland, the young prodigy graduated from high-school in 1896.</p>

                <p>In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein had what came to be known as
                    his
                    “Annus Mirabilis” — or “miracle year”. It was during this time that the young physicist obtained his
                    Doctorate degree and published four of his most influential research papers, including the Special
                    Theory of Relativity. In that, the now world famous equation "e = mc2" unlocked mysteries of the
                    Universe theretofore unknown.</p>

                <p>Ten years later, in 1915, Einstein completed his General Theory of Relativity and in 1921 he was
                    awarded
                    the Nobel Prize in Physics (iconic status cemented in 1919 when Arthur Eddington’s expedition
                    confirmed
                    Albert Einstein’s prediction). It also launched him to international superstardom and his name
                    became a
                    household word synonymous with genius all over the world.
                </p>

                <p>Einstein emigrated to the United States in the autumn of 1933 and took up residence in Princeton, New
                    Jersey and a professorship at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study.</p>

                <p>Today, the practical applications of Einstein’s theories include the development of the television,
                    remote control devices, automatic door openers, lasers, and DVD-players. Recognized as TIME
                    magazine’s
                    “Person of the Century” in 1999, Einstein’s intellect, coupled his strong passion for social
                    justice
                    and dedication to pacifism, left the world with infinite knowledge and pioneering moral
                    leadership.</p>
